# 0x15. API

## Description

This project focuses on building Python scripts to access employee data via an API and organize and export them to different data structures. It explores the limitations of Bash scripting and the benefits of using Python for such tasks.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the limitations of Bash scripting
- Learn what an API is and how it works
- Understand the concept of a REST API
- Explore the use of microservices
- Familiarize with the CSV and JSON formats
- Follow Pythonic naming conventions for packages, modules, classes, variables, functions, and constants

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- Libraries imported in Python files must be organized in alphabetical order
- A README.md file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code should use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for style checking
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using wc
- All modules should have documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
- Use `get` to access dictionary values by key (it won’t throw an exception if the key doesn’t exist)
- Code should not be executed when imported (by using `if __name__ == "__main__":`)
