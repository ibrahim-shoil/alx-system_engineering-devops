## Introduction

In today's digital landscape, cyber attacks have become increasingly sophisticated and prevalent. It is crucial for organizations to have a strong defense system in place to protect their sensitive data and infrastructure. The "Attack is the Best Defense" project aims to address this need by providing a comprehensive solution that combines various security measures.

## Features

- **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** The project includes an IDS that monitors network traffic and detects any suspicious or malicious activities. It uses advanced algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify potential threats.

- **Vulnerability Assessment:** The system conducts regular vulnerability assessments to identify weaknesses in the network and applications. It provides detailed reports and recommendations for remediation.

- **Threat Intelligence:** The project integrates with external threat intelligence sources to stay updated on the latest security threats and vulnerabilities. This information is used to enhance the defense system's effectiveness.

- **Real-time Monitoring:** The defense system provides real-time monitoring of network traffic, system logs, and user activities. It alerts administrators about any unusual or suspicious behavior, allowing them to take immediate action.

## Background Context

This project is NOT mandatory at all. It is 100% optional. Doing any part of this project will add a project grade of over 100% to your average. Your score won’t get hurt if you don’t do it, but if your current average is greater than your score on this project, your average might go down. Have fun!

## Tasks

### 0. ARP spoofing and sniffing unencrypted traffic
#advanced

Security is a vast topic, and network security is an important part of it. A lot of very sensitive information goes over networks that are used by many people, and some people might have bad intentions. Traffic going through a network can be intercepted by a malicious machine pretending to be another network device. Once the traffic is redirected to the malicious machine, the hacker can keep a copy of it and analyze it for potential interesting information. It is important to note that the traffic must then be forwarded to the actual device it was supposed to go (so that users and the system keep going as if nothing happened).

Any information that is not encrypted and sniffed by an attacker can be seen by the attacker - that could be your email password or credit card information. While today’s network security is much stronger than it used to be, there are still some legacy systems that are using unencrypted communication means. A popular one is telnet.

In this project, we will not go over ARP spoofing, but we’ll start by sniffing unencrypted traffic and getting information out of it.

Sendgrid offers is an emailing service that provides state of the art secure system to send emails, but also supports a legacy unsecured way: telnet. You can create an account for free, which is what I did, and send an email using telnet:
